# ColmarAcademy

This is the website I created for the fictional school Colmar Academy, as a final project for Codecademy's 'Build a Website with HTML, CSS and Github Pages'. 
I followed the provided wireframes as closely as I could to  get the layout, then I selected the background colors.
I chose colors that had some bright energy to them. I went with a subdued yellow for the banner, playing off the yellow tones found in the banner image. The information and thesis sections have a light blue background when hovered over. 

This is my first website project and first readme file. Thanks for reading!
